    <h1> This is a project my partner and I made where you would be able to customize your own burger. 
	 After you run the program it would greet you and then ask you a series of yes or no questions
	 It would ask if you wanted a certain ingredient on your burger and afterwards it asks you how many of those ingredients you want
	 After you answer all the questions the program gives you, your burger should be ready.<h1>
